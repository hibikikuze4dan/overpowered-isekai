These guilds mainly work as social hubs for adventurers who pick up contract jobs known as quests from the kingdoms or private individuals. Quests usually involves contracted monster slaying as Agaria is plagued with monsters, but the Adventurers Guild accept all kinds of work as long as there is a reward for it. To avoid putting less experienced adventurers in danger by allowing them to accept any quest, the guilds have developed a universal system to measure an individual's strength in levels. After careful evaluation each quest is given a level requirement.",

Kami Utau users are often priests, oracles, sages and hermits. Taijutsu is far more common than Kami Utau. Practiced by samurai, shinobi, monks and nobles. It is best described as a mix of magic and martial art, there are many different styles of Taijutsu.

Rhyvera was once populated by a race which combined science and magic, their empire spanned across the entire world and across the very stars. But at their apex of glory they were all wiped out. There are multiple ancient ruins spread across Rhyvera, remnants of this lost civilisation. Most people keep away from these ruins, as they are often guarded by ancient magitech sentinels. But some bold adventurers raid these ruins in hope of finding priceless magitech artifacts. The success and survival rate for raiding a ruin is extremely low, but the fame, glory and wealth one could obtain ensures the continuation of these raids. While most adventurers would sell a magitech artifact if they found one and then live out the rest of their lives in luxury. There are those who collect magitech artifacts and arm themselves with them. They continue to raid these ruins to uncover the mysteries of the lost race, these adventurers are called seekers.",

Each of the 7 legendary heroes who wielded The Black Arms later founded their own kingdom. Now the legendary weapons act as mere decoration, a symbol of the monarchs rightful rule. They also serve a deeper purpose, they are tools for keeping the balance between the 7 kingdoms. Ensuring an even power distribution between the different kingdoms. However if one of them would go missing, chaos and war would swiftly ensue. You could even destroy The Black Arms, to effectively return magic to the world.",

The academies of the empire teaches a different story, to them the High Empress is celebrated as Raxanix's savior, she is the one who brought an end to the mage wars and unified the world. Magic is heavily regulated in the empire, only a select few have the privilege of studying magic at one of the imperial mage academies. Unauthorized use of magic and unlawful possession of mana is punishable by death.
