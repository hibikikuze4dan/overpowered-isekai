    "Year hear a loud knock at your door, you open it and find a cute pink haired little girl in front of you. She seems a bit drowsy, like she had just woken up. The little girl stumble into your home without saying a word. After having inspected your room she nods and smiles, satisfied with her findings.",
    "\"You're just the kind of person l've been looking for. NEETS makes the best isekai protagonists. My name is Susie btw, I'm the archdemon of sloth and I have run out of isekai to watch. So I'm going to create my own IRL isekai and you're going to be the main character. I like long running series, so l'll start with granting you eternal youth. I don't really know what kind of isekai I'm in the mood for, so why don't you decide all details? Let's make this a game. You have 70 Isekai points to spend. I'll present you with some options and you get to pick the options you liked the most, but each option costs Isekai points. Once we are done you must have 0 or more Isekai points left.\"",
